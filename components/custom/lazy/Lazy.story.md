Not every component is equal. There are components that are more important and should be displayed immediately, while content further down the page wonâ€™t be visible right away anyway, so it can be loaded a bit later. Similarly, content that is shown in modals and popups, especially if there is a lot of it, does not need to be loaded upfront.

The Lazy component accepts three props - onVisible, onIdle, and idleTimeout. <br>
The onVisible prop indicates if a component should be rendered using an Intersection Observer. It accepts a boolean or a config object for the Intersection Observer. <br>
Next, we have onIdle prop. If it sets to true, then the component will be loaded using requestIdleCallback and requestAnimationFrame. The idleTimeout prop is a timeout number for the requestIdleCallback function

```vue
<template>
  <Lazy on-visible>
    <VeryLargeComponent />
  </Lazy>
</template>
```
